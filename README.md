# Timedoor Wrapper

## 03/09/2022 Update

Unfortunately, it seems as if the Timedoor API is transitioning to a payment system. I had found some time to work on this but as I was testing out
my code, I kept getting a HTTP status code 402 error. The website does not mention anything about this, but getting this error code leads me to believe that
Timedoor will soon not be a free API.

With that in mind, I will probably be unable to continue working on this unless the company I work for wants to use this API, I could then maybe continue creating this API
wrapper.

The repos contains a simple Python project for calling the [Timedoor](https://timedoor.io/) API. Timedoor is a time series analysis API that can be used to
gain insights on how your data is changing over time. For more information, visit their [website](https://timedoor.io/).

This repository will contain wrappers for all of the available endpoints provided by Timedoor. To see all the currently available endpoints, you can visit their [api documentation](https://timedoor.io/docs).
